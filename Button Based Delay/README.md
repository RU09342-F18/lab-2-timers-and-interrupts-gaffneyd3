The way this program worked, it used a combination of a button interupt and a timer interupt. First it set the inputs and outputs correctly to set up the button as an input and the led as an output. then it set up a timer and enabled all the interupts and cleared all of the flags. Upon initiating the program, it sets the clock to A clk, sets it to up mode and uses 8 divider. Then it sets the button to trigger on the rising edge. Then when the button is pressed, it detects if on the falling edge of the button, and resets the clock to stop counting upon release of the button. It does this by clearing the timer, and counting in continuous mode. Then it sets the second led to be on to signal if it is counting. Then when the button is released, it stops counting, resets the clock and sets it to up mode, and to count up to the time that was saved in the TA0 register. Then it clears the flags and goes back to toggling the LED.
