The way that this program works, it sets up the GPIO pins to be connected to the LEDS, and then sets up two clocks that are set up with Smlclk and 8 divider and set to count in up mode. It then sets the register corresponding to however fast the clock is set to, and then triggers the interupt when it hits that number. When the interupt is triggered, it toggles the corresponding LED correlated to that timer.
