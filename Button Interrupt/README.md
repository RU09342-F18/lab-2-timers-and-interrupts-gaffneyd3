This part of the lab was dedicated to the enabling of interupts and using them to blink an LED. The way this program works, it stops the watchdog timer, and sets the select bits to GPIO. Then it sets the direction of P1.0 to output, sets the direction of P1.3 to input, and enables the pull up-down resistor and sets the pull down resistor. Then it enables the interupt for p1.3 and enables the rising edge. It then clears the flag for P1 and enters low power pode and enables global intereupts. Then, when an interupt occurs, it toggles the LED and clears the flags again. This process basically enables the following: It goes into low power mode until you press the button. When the button is depressed, it toggles the LED.
